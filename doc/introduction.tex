The program \ty{alan} is a demo interface for the \ty{ancs} package.
It searches for homologous regions shared by two genomes. This search
is a fast anchor-based approximation of local alignments. The anchors
are long unique exact matches between a prefix of a query and a suffix
from a subject enhanced suffix array.
