The \texttt{intersect} and \texttt{ref2query} programs are designed
for analyzing common homologous regions in a set of target
genomes. \texttt{intersect} serves as a tool to identify shared
homologous regions across multiple target genomes. Building on the
output of intersect, \texttt{ref2query} locates the corresponding
homologous regions in a specific query genome.
