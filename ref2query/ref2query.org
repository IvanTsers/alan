The program \texttt{ref2query} takes a \texttt{fasta} file of shared
homologous regions (an \textit{intersection}) as input, with the
coordinates of segregating sites included in the headers. This file is
generated by \texttt{intersect -s}. The program outputs either the
coordinates or sequences of the corresponding regions in a query
genome. It identifies these regions by performing an exact match of
the leftmost anchor of the homologous regions and extending the match
to the length of the homologous region. An exact matching anchor is a
prefix of the intersection that ends before the first segregating
site.

\texttt{ref2query} includes hooks for imports, auxiliary functions,
and the main function.
